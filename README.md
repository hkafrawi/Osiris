In Egypt, inflation is becoming a threat to food security. Food prices are ever increasing to unprecedented prices while wages are realtively the same. Regardless of the many reasons for this happening, i am concerned with providing a tool to the public, policy makers and those interested to plan their grocery purchases with relative food macros and nutrients.

Possible questions id like this tool to answer would be:
- With an allowance of XXX which food would provide the most affordable protein? calorie? fat? carb?
- Can an allowance of XXX enable a healthy diet for an indvidual? a family?
- Which time of the year is protein the cheapest? 

I am intially working with the dataset that have food prices such as World Food Programme, food macros such as U.S. Department of Agriculture food details and I am still searching for a dataset for wages.

Osiris, the Egyptian god of ancient Egypt who was associated with food, agriculture and fertitly of the land is the inspiration for the name of this project. Although, the focus of the project will be on Egypt, I aspire that it would expand to other societies facing famine and hunger around the world (or maybe the universe one day).
